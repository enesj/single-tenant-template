# manufacturers (dev)

Analyze articles without a `manufacturer_id`, extract potential brand/manufacturer names
from `canonical_name`, create new manufacturer records, and wire articles to them.

Uses `postgres-mcp` (`mcp__postgres__execute_sql`) for all reads and writes against the
**local dev database**.

---

## Response size rules (non-negotiable)

- **Summarise, don't repeat** — describe SQL results in tables or bullet points, not raw rows.
- **Per-phase summaries only** — concise status lines after each phase.
- **Article tables** — compact Markdown, max 50 rows visible; if more, state count.

---

## Hard rules (non-negotiable)

- **`normalized_key` convention**: lowercase, hyphens for spaces/special chars, no diacritics
  (e.g. `"Zlatni Korijen"` -> `zlatni-korijen`, `"Dr. Luigi"` -> `dr-luigi`, `"Semić"` -> `semic`).
- **No duplicate manufacturers** — always check existing manufacturers before creating.
- **ILIKE pattern safety** — use anchored/specific patterns to avoid false matches:
  - Prefix anchor for common words: `'Nordic%'` not `'%Nordic%'`
  - Trailing space for short words: `'Seth %'` not `'%Seth%'`
  - Dot anchor for abbreviations: `'Domest.%'` not `'%Domest%'`
- **Batch-first** — use single INSERT for all new manufacturers, then batch UPDATE for wiring.
- **Verify after every write phase** — confirm counts match expectations.
- **dm sub-brands** — Denkmit, Dmbio, Jessa, Mivolis, Profissimo, Balea, Alverde all map to
  manufacturer `dm` (not separate manufacturer entries).

## Phase 0: Survey the landscape

### Step 0a — Count articles without manufacturer

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE manufacturer_id IS NULL) AS without_manufacturer
FROM articles;
```

### Step 0b — Fetch unmanufactured article names

```sql
SELECT id, canonical_name
FROM articles
WHERE manufacturer_id IS NULL
ORDER BY canonical_name;
```

### Step 0c — Fetch all existing manufacturers

```sql
SELECT display_name FROM manufacturers ORDER BY display_name;
```

---

## Phase 1: Extract potential manufacturer names

Analyze each `canonical_name` and identify words/tokens that are likely brand or
manufacturer names. Use these heuristics:

### Identification heuristics

| Signal | Example | Confidence |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Non-Bosnian capitalized word | "Zbregov", "Karington", "Nordic" | High |
| Known brand pattern at start/end | "Denkmit sredstvo za..." | High |
| Pharma drug brand name | "Voltaren", "Euthyrox", "Nebilet" | High |
| Foreign word (German, English, Italian) | "Brotlinies", "Tartaruga", "Munchmallow" | High |
| Truncated brand at name boundary | "...Bosnalij" (= Bosnalijek) | Medium |
| ALL-CAPS word in mixed name | "ESENBAK BULARDI" | Medium |

### Anti-patterns (do NOT treat as manufacturer)

| Token | Why | Action |
|-------|-----|--------|
| Intenso, Classic, Soft, Forte, Espresso, Prženi | Product descriptors | Skip |
| Product words: jogurt, sir, kafa, šećer, hljeb | Common Bosnian nouns | Skip |
| City/country names: Brazil, Paris, Bayreuth | Origin, not manufacturer (usually) | Skip unless clearly a brand |
| Size/weight: 1KG, 500G, 250ML | Units | Skip |
| Truncated < 3 chars: "Dr", "Su", "Wh" | Too short to be sure alone | Check context |

### Output structure

Organize findings into three groups:

1. **Already in DB** — articles whose brand matches an existing manufacturer (wire immediately)
2. **dm sub-brands** — articles with dm house-brand names (wire to `dm`)
3. **New manufacturers needed** — articles with identifiable brands not yet in manufacturers table

For each candidate, note:
- Proposed `display_name` and `normalized_key`
- ILIKE pattern for matching
- Which article(s) it covers

Present to user as a Markdown table for review before proceeding.

## Phase 2: Wire articles to existing manufacturers

For brands that match existing manufacturers, run targeted UPDATEs:

```sql
-- Pattern: one UPDATE per existing manufacturer
UPDATE articles
SET manufacturer_id = (SELECT id FROM manufacturers WHERE display_name = '<Manufacturer>')
WHERE manufacturer_id IS NULL
AND canonical_name ILIKE '<pattern>';
```

### dm sub-brands (batch together)

```sql
UPDATE articles
SET manufacturer_id = (SELECT id FROM manufacturers WHERE display_name = 'dm')
WHERE manufacturer_id IS NULL
AND (
  canonical_name ILIKE 'Denkmit%'
  OR canonical_name ILIKE 'Dmbio%'
  OR canonical_name ILIKE 'Jessa %'
  OR canonical_name ILIKE 'Mivolis%'
  OR canonical_name ILIKE 'Profissimo%'
  OR canonical_name ILIKE 'Balea%'
  OR canonical_name ILIKE 'Alverde%'
);
```

Verify with:

```sql
SELECT a.canonical_name, m.display_name AS manufacturer
FROM articles a
JOIN manufacturers m ON a.manufacturer_id = m.id
WHERE m.display_name IN ('<list of matched manufacturers>')
ORDER BY m.display_name, a.canonical_name;
```

---

## Phase 3: Create new manufacturers + wire articles

### Step 3a — Batch INSERT all new manufacturers

```sql
INSERT INTO manufacturers (id, display_name, normalized_key) VALUES
(gen_random_uuid(), '<DisplayName1>', '<normalized-key-1>'),
(gen_random_uuid(), '<DisplayName2>', '<normalized-key-2>'),
...;
```

### Step 3b — Batch UPDATE to wire articles

Use a single UPDATE with FROM join for efficiency:

```sql
UPDATE articles a
SET manufacturer_id = m.id
FROM manufacturers m
WHERE a.manufacturer_id IS NULL
AND (
  (m.display_name = '<Mfr1>' AND a.canonical_name ILIKE '<pattern1>')
  OR (m.display_name = '<Mfr2>' AND a.canonical_name ILIKE '<pattern2>')
  ...
);
```

Split into multiple UPDATE batches if > 25 conditions (keeps SQL readable).

### Step 3c — Verify

```sql
SELECT m.display_name AS manufacturer, COUNT(*) AS articles_linked
FROM articles a
JOIN manufacturers m ON a.manufacturer_id = m.id
WHERE m.display_name IN ('<list of new manufacturers>')
GROUP BY m.display_name
ORDER BY m.display_name;
```

## Phase 4: Update taxonomy files (conditional)

If new brand-to-manufacturer mappings were established, update the taxonomy files
so future `articles_research.clj` runs recognize them automatically:

| File | When to update |
|------|---------------|
| `scripts/bb/articles/taxonomy/self-named-brands.edn` | Brand name = manufacturer name (e.g. "Zbregov", "Cekin") |
| `scripts/bb/articles/taxonomy/brand-parent-mappings.edn` | Brand differs from parent (e.g. "Nocko" -> "Milkos") |

---

## Phase 5: Final report

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS total,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE manufacturer_id IS NULL) AS without_manufacturer,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE manufacturer_id IS NOT NULL) AS with_manufacturer,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE manufacturer_id IS NOT NULL) / COUNT(*), 1) AS coverage_pct
FROM articles;
```

Report:
1. **Existing manufacturers linked** — count per manufacturer
2. **New manufacturers created** — count, with article counts
3. **Coverage change** — before vs after percentages
4. **Remaining unmanufactured** — note that ~40-60% of articles (generic produce, services, bags, etc.) legitimately have no manufacturer

---

## Completion gate

- [ ] All identifiable brand names in article names have been matched
- [ ] No duplicate manufacturers created (checked before INSERT)
- [ ] ILIKE patterns verified to not cause false matches
- [ ] Counts verified after each write phase
- [ ] Taxonomy files updated if new brand mappings discovered
- [ ] Final coverage % reported
