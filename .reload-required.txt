BROWSER RELOAD REQUIRED

The fix for the "Unknown comparison operator: raw" error has been applied to:
  src/app/shared/validation/constraints.cljc

The code now filters out :raw check constraints which are SQL-specific and 
cannot be validated client-side.

To apply the fix:
1. Wait for Shadow CLJS to recompile (watch for "Build completed" in logs)
2. Hard refresh the browser (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+F5 on Windows)
3. If still seeing the error, clear browser cache and reload

The fix ensures that email validation with regex patterns like:
  [:raw "email ~* '^[^\\s@]+@[^\\s@]+\\.[^\\s@]+$'"]
will be skipped during frontend validation and only enforced at the database level.
